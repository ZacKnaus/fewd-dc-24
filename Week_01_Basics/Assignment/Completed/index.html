      <p>The Xia dynasty (Chinese: 夏朝; pinyin: Xià Cháo; Wade–Giles: Hsia-Ch'ao; IPA:
      [ɕiâ tʂʰɑ̌ʊ̯]; c. 2070 – c. 1600 BC) is the first dynasty in traditional Chinese
      history. It is described in ancient historical chronicles such as the Bamboo
      Annals, the Classic of History and the Records of the Grand Historian.
      According to tradition, the dynasty was established by the legendary Yu the
      Great<sup><a href=#c1>[1]</a></sup> after Shun, the last of the Five Emperors, gave his throne to him.
      The Xia was later succeeded by the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC).</p>

      <p>According to the traditional chronology based upon calculations by Liu Xin, the
      Xia ruled between 2205 and 1766 BC; according to the chronology based upon the
      Bamboo Annals, it ruled between 1989 and 1558 BC. The Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology
      Project concluded that the Xia existed between 2070 and 1600 BC. The tradition
      of tracing Chinese political history from heroic early emperors to the Xia to
      succeeding dynasties comes from the idea of the Mandate of Heaven, in which
      only one legitimate dynasty can exist at any given time, and was promoted by
      the Confucian school in the Eastern Zhou period, later becoming the basic
      position of imperial historiography and ideology. Although the Xia is an
      important element in early Chinese history, reliable information on the history
      of China before 13th century BC can only come from archaeological evidence
      since China's first established written system on a durable medium, the oracle
      bone script, did not exist until then;<sup><a href=#c2>[2]</a></sup> however, no mention of the Xia, or
      the supposed conquest of the Xia by the Shang, is found in any oracle bones
      found to date. The first documentary reference to the Xia dates from more than
      a thousand years later. Thus, concrete existence for the Xia is yet to be
      proven, despite efforts by Chinese archaeologists to link the Xia with Bronze
      Age Erlitou archaeological sites.<sup><a href=#c3>[3]</a></sup></p>

      <h2 id="Traditional_accounts">Traditional accounts</h2>

      <p>The Xia dynasty was described in classic texts such as the Classic of History (
      Shujing), the Bamboo Annals, and the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) by
      Sima Qian. According to tradition, the Huaxia were the ancestral people of the
      Han Chinese.<sup><a href=#c4>[4]</a></sup><sup><a href=#c5>[5]</a></sup></p>

      <h3 id="Origins_and_early_development">Origins and early development</h3>

      <p>Traditional histories trace the development of the Xia to the legendary Three
      Sovereigns and Five Emperors. According to ancient Chinese texts, before the
      Xia dynasty was established, battles were frequent between the Xia tribe and
      Chi You's tribe. The Xia tribe slowly developed around the time of Zhuanxu, one
      of the Five Emperors. The Records of the Grand Historian and the Classic of
      Rites say that Yu the Great is the grandson of Zhuanxu, but there are also
      other records, like Ban Gu, that say Yu is the fifth generation of Zhuanxu.
      Based on this, tradition ascribes the ancestry of the Xia clan to Zhuanxu.<sup><a href=#>[

      <h3 id="Guns_attempt_to_stop_the_flood">Gun's attempt to stop the flood</h3>

      <h4 id="See_also">See also: <a href=#>Great Flood (China)</a></h4>
      <br>
      <p>Gun, the father of Yu the Great, is the earliest recorded member of the Xia
      clan. When the Yellow River flooded, many tribes united together to control and
      stop the flooding. Gun was appointed by Yao to stop the flooding. He ordered
      the construction of large blockades to block the path of the water. The attempt
      of Gun to stop the flooding lasted for nine years, but it was a failure because
      the floods became stronger. After nine years, Yao had already given his throne
      to Shun. Gun was ordered to be imprisoned for life to reform the Eastern
      Barbarians by Shun at Yushan (Chinese: 羽山), a mountain located between modern
      Donghai County in Jiangsu Province and Linshu County in Shandong Province.<sup>
      <a href=#>[citation needed]</a></sup></p>

      <h3 id="Yu_the_Greats_attempt_to_stop_the_flood">Yu the Great's attempt to stop the floods</h3>

      <p>Yu was highly trusted by Shun, so Shun appointed him to finish his father's
      work, which was to stop the flooding. Yu's method was different from his
      father's: he organized people from different tribes and ordered them to help
      him build canals in all the major rivers that were flooding and lead the water
      out to the sea. Yu was dedicated to his work. People praised his perseverance
      and were inspired, so much so that other tribes joined in the work. Legend says
      that in the 13 years it took him to successfully complete the work to stop the
      floods, he never went back to his home village to stop and rest, even though he
      passed by his house three times.<sup><a href=#>[citation needed]</a></sup></p>

      <h3 id="Establishment">Establishment</h3>

      <p>Yu's success in stopping the flooding increased agricultural production (since
      the floods were destructive). The Xia tribe's power increased and Yu became the
      leader of the surrounding tribes. Soon afterwards Shun sent Yu to lead an army
      to suppress the Sanmiao tribe, which continuously abused the border tribes.
      After defeating them, he exiled them south to the Han River area. This victory
      strengthened the Xia tribe's power even more. As Shun aged, he thought of a
      successor and relinquished the throne to Yu, whom he deemed worthy. Yu's
      succession marks the start of the Xia dynasty. As Yu neared death he passed the
      throne to his son, Qi, instead of passing it to the most capable candidate,
      thus setting the precedent for dynastic rule or the Hereditary System. The Xia
      dynasty began a period of family or clan control.<sup><a href=#>[
      citation needed]</a></sup> It is believed that Zhenxun (modern Gongyi) was one 
      of the capitals of the dynasty.</p>

      <h3 id="Overthrow">Overthrow</h3>

      <p>Jie, the last king, was said to be corrupt. He was overthrown by Tang, the
      first king of the Shang dynasty. Tang is said to have given the small state of
      Qi as a fief to the remnants of the Xia ruling family.</p>

      <h2 id="Modern_skipticism">Modern skepticism</h2>

      <p>No mention of the Xia dynasty survives from anything near contemporary sources.
      Oracle bones dating from the Shang dynasty, which otherwise record ancestral
      rulers from the supposed time of the Xia, and conflicts of the Shang with even
      relatively small tribes, do not mention the existence of the Xia, or the
      conflict between the Shang and the Xia recorded in later sources. The first
      written mention of the Xia dynasty does not occur until the Western Zhou
      dynasty, with references on bronzeware. Narratives of Xia dynasty people and
      events do not appear until sources dating from later in the Zhou dynasty.</p>

      <p>The paucity of written evidence and the time gap between the supposed time of
      the Xia and the first written references to it have meant that the historicity
      of the Xia dynasty itself and the traditional narrative of its history is at
      best uncertain. The Skeptical School of early Chinese history, started by Gu
      Jiegang in the 1920s, was the first group of scholars within China to
      systematically question the traditional story of its early history. By
      critically examining the development of the narrative of early Chinese history
      throughout history, Gu concluded "the later the time, the longer the legendary
      period of earlier history... early Chinese history is a tale told and retold
      for generations, during which new elements were added to the front end".<sup><a href=#c6>[6]</a></sup>
      Among other points, Gu and other historians note certain parallels between the
      traditional narrative of Xia history and Shang history that suggest Zhou-era
      fabrication or at least embellishment of Xia history. Yun Kuen Lee's criticism
      of nationalist sentiment in developing an explanation of Three Dynasties
      chronology focuses on the dichotomy of evidence provided by archaeological
      versus historical research, in particular the claim that the archaeological
      Erlitou Culture is also the historical Xia dynasty. "How to fuse the
      archaeological dates with historical dates is a challenge to all chronological
      studies of early civilization."<sup><a href=#c6>[6]</a></sup></p>

      <p>In The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China, Sarah Allan
      noted that many aspects of the Xia are simply the opposite of traits held to be
      emblematic of the Shang dynasty. The implied dualism between the Shang and Xia,
      Allan argues, is that while the Shang represent fire or the sun, birds and the
      east, the Xia represent the west and water. The development of this mythical
      Xia, Allan argues, is a necessary act on the part of the Zhou dynasty, who
      justify their conquest of the Shang by noting that the Shang had supplanted the
      Xia.</p>

      <h2 id="Archaeological_discoveries">Archaeological discoveries</h2>

      <h4 id="See_also2">See also: <a href=#>Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project</a></h4>
      <br>
      <p>Archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs that
      point to the possible existence of the Xia dynasty at locations cited in
      ancient Chinese historical texts. There exists a debate as to whether or not
      the Erlitou culture was the site of the Xia dynasty. Radiocarbon dating places
      the site at c. 2100 to 1800 BC, providing physical evidence of the existence of
      a state contemporaneous with and possibly equivalent to the Xia dynasty as
      described in Chinese historical works.<sup><a href=#c7>[7]</a></sup> In 1959, a site located in the city
      of Yanshi was excavated containing large palaces that some archaeologists have
      attributed to capital of the Xia dynasty. Through the 1960s and 1970s,
      archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs in the
      same locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts regarding Xia;<sup><a href=#c8>[8]</a></sup> at
      a minimum, the Xia dynasty marked an evolutionary stage between the late
      neolithic cultures and the typical Chinese urban civilization of the Shang
      dynasty.<sup><a href=#c8>[8]</a></sup></p>

      <p>In 2011, Chinese archaeologists uncovered the remains of an imperial sized
      palace—dated to about 1700 BC—at Erlitou in Henan, further fueling the
      discussions about the existence of the dynasty.<sup><a href=#c9>[9]</a></sup></p>

      <p>The following table lists the rulers of Xia according to Sima Qian's Shiji.
      Unlike Sima's list of Shang dynasty kings, which is closely matched by
      inscriptions on oracle bones from late in that period, records of Xia rulers
      have not yet been found in archeological excavations of contemporary sites, or
      records on later Shang dynasty oracle bones.</p>
